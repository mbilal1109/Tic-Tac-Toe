# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game repository! This project implements a simple yet engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript. The game can be played using the link, where two players take turns to mark the spaces in a 3×3 grid.

## How the Game Works

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking a spot on a 3×3 grid. One player marks with an 'X' and the other with an 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is declared a draw.
